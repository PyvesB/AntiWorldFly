# Setting your own working copy of the project

The following steps are for the [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) development environment, but will be similar on other IDEs.

* Download or clone the repository on your computer. You can also create your own fork by clicking on the *Fork* icon on the top right of the page.
* In Eclipse, go to *File* -> *Import...* -> *Maven* -> *Existing Maven Projects*.
* In the *Root Directory* field, select the location where you downloaded the Anti World Fly repository.
* Tick the *pom.xml* box that appears in the *Projects* field and click *Finish*.
* To compile the plugin, in the *Package Explorer* window, right click on the imported project, then *Run As* -> *Maven Install*.
* The plugin will be generated in the *target* folder of the project.
